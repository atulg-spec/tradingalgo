Admin can flex the price of this buying and selling through the admin, admin can reduce it as well as increase it.
According to that how will be our charge and we will show those charges in users portfolio.

We held this stock in the user's portfolio. This much price was given, this much was sold.
How much was your margin and how much was your profit, how much was your loss.
We have to show all those calculations.
The user will test it and then a profile will come after that.
His details will be visible in the profile.
